		README file for the htable package


See the file Changelog for a release history and bug-fix notes.
See the file TODO for things that still need doing.


PACKAGE OVERVIEW:

	You should be reading this file in a directory called: htable-x.x,
	where x.x is the current version number. There should be two 
	subdirectories : 'src' and 'tst'. 
	The hash table API sources are found in one single file: src/htable.h.
        Detailed documentation comes in the manpage htable.3 found in the 'src'
	directory. 


DOCUMENTATION:

        As this package is primarily intended to C developers, the documentation
        is only available as a manpage (file htable.3 in 'src' directory). To
        view it, you can use a command such as:

             groff -t -man -Tascii htable.3 | less


TESTS:
        
        The package comes with automated tests found in the 'tst' directory,
        which can be run by using the following command (you may need to replace
        'make' by 'gmake' on some systems):

              cd tst && make test

        Here is a description of the performed tests:
             
             test0: hash table static initialization
             test1: hash table dynamic initialization
             test2: simple insertion into hash table
             test3: lookup in hash table
             test4: hash table scan
             test5: removing of item from hash table
             test6: hash table passed to a subroutine
             test7: multiple insertion of same element


LICENSE:

        This package comes with a two-clause BSD license. You can find the text
        for this license at the beginning of htable.h.
